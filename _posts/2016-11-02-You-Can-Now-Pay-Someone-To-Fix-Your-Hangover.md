Let's Make Billions is a comedy podcast that starts a new business each and every week and has a habit of predicting the future.

3 weeks ago we did a post about [3 Times This Podcast Has Already Predicted The God Damn Future](http://www.letsmakebillions.com/blog-posts/3-Times-This-Podcast-Predicted-The-Future/) and it's happened again, except this time we've been beaten to the punch!

On this week's [episode w/ Tessa Ryan](http://www.letsmakebillions.com/episodes/Ep15-Uber-but-for/) we tried to start as many insane uber clones as we could in 30 minutes. One of them was a service that deals with the after affects of a night of drinks, crazy right? Wrong. It's an actual thing that currently exists and you can get it in Melbourne (and Perth but who wants to go there).

Enter the frame [hangoverhelpers.com.au](http://www.hangoverhelpers.com.au/) (love that SEO work), a service who will come to you to provide cleaning, breakfast & Powerade all round. Breakfast comes in two shades, green and greasy for whatever floats your hungover boat.

At a cost of around $200 it isn't cheap but in the moment we reckon plenty of people would stump up the cash.

The only thing missing is someone to hug you on the couch, till our business launches you'll have to BYO big spoon but hey, it's progress!
