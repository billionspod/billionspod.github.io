Episode 8!

Peter Jones joins Billions Inc to start a Hipster tour company.

Sydney has the harbour bridge, Melbourne has hipsters. Now that the trend is ending it's the perfect time for mainstream Australia to get on board.

Hate tourism at its finest.

Try a fixie, drink an expensive coffee and pat a sedated hipster. It's all just a part of the deal.

Have a listen.
