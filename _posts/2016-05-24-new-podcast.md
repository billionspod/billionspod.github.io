Hey everyone! This is the website for my brand new podcast!

I really want to start a business but havenâ€™t found the exact right idea yet, thankfully I have some friends to help me out.

Murphy McLachlan & I create a bar for dogs, Kate Dehnert & I devise a truly evil kebab directory app and Tessa Ryan concocts the most lucrative baby sitting service of all time. 

The podcast should launch in the next few weeks, but for now follow us on social media to get updates as soon as the first episode hits!
