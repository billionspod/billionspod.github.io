Let's Make Billions is a comedy podcast that starts a new business each and every week.

We've been running 9 weeks now and in that time we've already managed to predict the future 3 times, the world is a crazy place.

### 1. A Bar for Dogs Now Genuinely Exists and We've Been There

In episode 1 of the podcast **Murphy McLachlan** & Simon started a bar for dogs.

Two weeks after recording it was announced that Melbourne would be getting its very own cafe for dogs **The Dog House**, it was around the corner from Simon's house AND IT SERVES BEER FOR DOGS!

We even did a bonus episode where the boys went to scope out the competion so you can listen all about it!

Since then yet another doggie crazed thing has opened with a dog themed foodtruck that also serves beer! Melbourne has gone dog alcohol crazy and Let's Make Billions predicted it all.

### 2. $26 Coffees Are Like 2 Years Worth of Inflation Away

In episode 9, **Peter Jones** & Simon created a Melbourne Hipster Tour company that took a last minute pivot in the first meeting and became solely a coffee shop that sold $26 coffees.

Move forward 3 weeks and Broadsheet is running an article on a [new cafe offering a $16 coffee](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/food-and-drink/article/asskicker-coffee).

The future is here and baby the coffees be expensive.

### 3. This Podcast is Great Just Like We Said it Would Be
