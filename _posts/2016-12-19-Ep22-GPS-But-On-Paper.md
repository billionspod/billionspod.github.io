Episode 22!

Comedians Sonia Di Iorio & Beau Stegmann join to start a business suggested by listener @1AussieNerd1 to deal with the unreliability of GPS by printing the maps out on paper!

Sonia and Beau are dubious at first but we eventually stumble across the niche market of doomsday preppers and it gets really evil and really excellent from there.

Listen to the episode now!
